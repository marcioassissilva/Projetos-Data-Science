**Why I decided to learn about Data Science:**

Seeing the transformation that has been taking place in the world and facing a need to contribute to a better Education,  I decided to learn about Data Science for some reasons. I think this field is incredible and extremely relevant to the world. Through Data Science, we can discover several insights and impact the ecosystem in which we live. I believe that Data Science can bring significant advances to any area. In my point of view, education is the most powerful tool for transforming people's lives. This is the main reason why I want to learn Data Science. So I intend to record the entire learning process during this journey. In this space, I intend to register my project portfolio throughout my studies.
